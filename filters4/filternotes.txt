1. Filters trained on 675 images of pexels with bilinear degradation
2. Angle=24 Strength=3 Coherence=3 setting for both filters
3. Cheapupscale: using output with bilinear upscaling for 1st pass, using output from 1st pass filter as cheapupscale of 2nd pass.
4. 1st and 2nd pass filters both trained on higher sharpened HR as reference (s=1.5)
